# Safe Haven: Survival Packs + Solar Charger for Homeless Women  
**A dignity-preserving kit with hygiene essentials, safety tools, and a custom solar charger - designed with unhoused women.**  

### The Problem  
Homeless women face:  
- **No hygiene access**: Period products, wipes, and soap are scarce
- **Safety risks**: Isolation + dead phone batteries = danger
- **No power**: Phones die, cutting access to shelters, jobs, and families

### The Solution  
**Safe Haven Packs include:**  
- **Custom solar charger** (low-cost, durable, designed by me *needs funding for prototyping*)  
- Hygiene kit (tampons, underwear, bras, socks, wipes, soap)  
- Safety items (whistle, emergency resources)  
- *Future*: NFC linked to local resource guide and a potential clean water solution

### **Why Fund *Me*?**  
1. **I’m building the tech**: The solar charger isn’t off-the-shelf, I’m designing it for extreme durability and low cost.  
2. **Proven track record**: See my open-source hardware work on [Moonrat](https://github.com/PubInv/moonrat) (portable incubator for water testing). 
3. **Community-driven**: Packs are co-designed with the female houseless community in Tulsa, Oklahoma and New York City.

*(Partnerships in progress,funding will accelerate prototype talks!)*  

### Funding Needs

- **Solar charger R&D**: $10k (prototyping, testing, tooling)
